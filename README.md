## Getting Started  üéâ

In the Webb Protocol, the relayer is a multi-faceted oracle, data relayer, and protocol governance participant. Relayers fulfill the role of an oracle where the external data sources that they listen to are the state of the anchors for a bridge. Relayers, as their name entails, relay information for a connected set of Anchors on a bridge. This information is then used to update the state of each Anchor and allow applications to reference, both privately and potentially not, properties of data stored across the other connected Anchors.

The relayer system is composed of three main components. Each of these components should be thought of as entirely separate because they could be handled by different entities entirely.

1. Private transaction relaying (of user bridge transactions like Tornado Cash‚Äôs relayer)
2. Data querying (for zero-knowledge proof generation)
3. Data proposing and signature relaying (of DKG proposals)

For additional information, please refer to the [Webb Relayer Rust Docs](docs.webb.tools/relayer/) üìù

### Top-level directory layout

```

  |____tx_queue.rs          # A queue for orderly handling of transactions.
  |____handler.rs           # Logic for what to do when a client is interacting with this relayer.
  |____config.rs            # Functionality related to parsing of configurable values.
  |____events_watcher       # Sync to different network types (EVM, Substrate), and act on different events. 
  |____service.rs           # The entry for tasks once the relayer is operating.
  |____main.rs              # Build and start the relayer.
  |____probe.rs             # Debugging relayer lifecycle, sync state, or other relayer state.          
  |____utils.rs             # Common functionality.

```

### Prerequisites

This repo uses Rust so it is required to have a Rust developer environment set up. First install and configure rustup:

  ```bash
# Install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# Configure
source ~/.cargo/env
  ```
Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable version, add nightly:

```bash
rustup default stable
rustup update
rustup update nightly
```

Great! Now your rust environment is ready! üöÄüöÄ

### Installation üíª

#### Unix (Linux, macOS, WSL2, ..)

```
git clone https://github.com/webb-tools/relayer.git

cargo build --release
```

## Usage

### Quick Start ‚ö°

TODO: @dutterbutter create a task for someone to update outdated preset configs

#### Local Substrate Mixer

Eager to try out the Webb Relayer, or need something quick for development? Run a relayer with our preset Substrate mixer configuration to get up and running immediately. 

```
 ./target/release/webb-relayer -c config/local-substrate -vv
```

TODO: @dutterbutter add more context to above command

 Run a relayer for a local substrate node that integrates our pallets:
[webb-standalone-node](https://github.com/webb-tools/protocol-substrate/)

#### Local EVM Tornado

Run a relayer with our preset EVM Anchor configuration to get up and running immediately.  

```
./target/release/webb-relayer -c config/config-tornados/ethereum -vv
```

### Run üèÉ

TODO: @dutterbutter clear up requirements for .env and config file, mention logger verbosity

Webb Relayer is easy to run and with flexible config üëå, to test it out first you have to create a config file

Example:

* Create a .env file with the following values for the networks you wish to support

```
WEBB_EVM_<network>_ENABLED=true
WEBB_EVM_<network>_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>

WEBB_EVM_<network>_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>

```

> Checkout [config](./config) for useful default configurations for many networks. These config files can be changed to your preferences, and are enabled with the .env configuration listed above.

Then Simply run

```
webb-relayer -vv -c ./config
```

> Hot Tip üå∂Ô∏è: you could also use the json format for the config files if you prefer that, and it would work!

### Configuration

The table below documents all the configuration options available for both chain and contract set ups. For a completed example, check out [Harmony's testnet configuration](./config/config-tornados/harmony/testnet1.toml). 

TODO: @dutterbutter outline evm / substrate specific config options (some are missing e.g. `runtime`)

#### Chain Configuration
| Field | Description | Optionality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `http-endpoint` | Http(s) Endpoint for quick Req/Res | Required |
| `ws-endpoint`  | Websocket Endpoint for long living connections | Required |
| `explorer`  | Block explorer, used for generating clickable links for transactions that happens on this chain. | Optional |
| `chain-id`  | Chain specific id. | Required |
| `private-key`  | The Private Key of this account on this network. See [PrivateKey Docs for secure setup]()| Required | 
| `beneficiary`  | The address of the account that will receive relayer fees. | Optional | 

#### Contract Configuration
| Field | Description | Optionality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contract `  | Chain contract. Must be either: </br> - Anchor (tornado protocol) </br>  - Anchor2 (darkwebb protocol) </br> - SignatureBridge </br> - GovernanceBravoDelegate | Required |
| `address`  | The address of this contract on this chain. | Required |
| `deployed-at`  | The block number where this contract got deployed at. | Required |
| `size`  | The size of this contract. **Note**: only available for `Anchor` and `Anchor2` contracts. | Optional |
| `events-watcher`  | Control the events watcher for this contract. | Optional |
| `withdraw-fee-percentage`  | The fee percentage that your account will receive when you relay a transaction over this chain.| Optional |
| `withdraw-gaslimit`  | A hex value of the gaslimit when doing a withdraw relay transaction on this chain. | Optional |

### Docker üê≥

To Use Docker in and to run the relayer on any cloud provider, all you need is to create your configuration and `.env` files
as it is shown above, save it into a `config` directory then you run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_CONFIGS_DIRECTORY>:/config" --env-file .env -p 9955:9955 ghcr.io/webb-tools/relayer:edge
```

> Note: this uses the latest and pre-released version deployed from `main` branch, change `edge` to the latest stable release version.

This will mount a configuration files at the `/config` directory inside the container so it would allow it to read the configuration you added.
